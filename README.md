# ChurnScope-Customer-Retention-Analysis-Dashboard
A data-driven Tableau dashboard project to analyze customer churn patterns, segment behavior, and improve user retention through smart insights.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses. This dashboard helps identify who’s leaving—and more importantly, why. By analyzing tenure, plan types, customer types, and engagement stages, the project identifies churn drivers and provides a foundation for effective retention strategies.

Built using Tableau, the dashboard turns raw data into actionable insights that business leaders can use to reduce churn and improve lifetime value.
